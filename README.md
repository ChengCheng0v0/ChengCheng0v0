## About Me
I'm a student currently exploring **Java** and **Vue.js**. I have experience in front-end development and can work with the **Vue** framework, though I often prefer more lightweight frameworks or native technologies for simpler projects. On the back-end, I have a solid foundation in **Java** and use the **Spring** framework to develop web applications.

I've also worked on desktop applications using **Node.js** and **Electron**. Previously, I developed websites for small companies and individuals.

## Skills

## Interests
Besides coding, I enjoy tinkering with hardware as a hobby, including experimenting with soft routers and NAS setups. I love free software and am a big fan of **Linux**, which is my preferred operating system.
