## About Me

Hi there! I'm from Chengdu, Sichuan, China. I love programming and am currently learning Rust!  
I have some basic front-end development skills and enjoy creating small websites (like [this](https://hic.top) one).  
I used to write Java, but now I've mostly forgotten it~

In addition to programming, I love tinkering with hardware, including **NAS** and **soft router** setups.  
I'm a passionate supporter of free software and a loyal fan of **Linux**, my favorite operating system.  
My current distribution of choice is **NixOS**.

## My Skills

- **Front-end Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js (just a bit)
- **Back-end Development**: Rust, Node.js
- **CLI/TUI Programs**: Rust
- **GUI Programs**: Node.js, Electron (transitioning to Tauri once I master Rust!)
- **DevOps and System Management**:
  - **Linux** (daily user)
  - **Networking** (basic knowledge)
  - **Technologies**: Docker, Systemd, Caddy, MySQL, etc.
